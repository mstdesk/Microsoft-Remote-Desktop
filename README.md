## Introduction

Microsoft Remote Desktop is a professional remote access client that lets you securely connect to Windows PCs, servers, and virtual desktops from virtually anywhere. Designed for business and IT workflows, it provides a reliable way to access corporate resources, run applications, and manage systems without being physically present at the machine. The app supports standard Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) connectivity and works well with Remote Desktop Services (RDS) environments and enterprise networks.

With Microsoft Remote Desktop, you can save connection profiles, organize desktops and apps, and quickly reconnect to frequently used endpoints. It includes features that improve productivity during remote sessions, such as clipboard integration, audio redirection, and support for multiple displays (depending on the platform and configuration). Security is a key focus: connections can be protected through authentication mechanisms and encrypted transport, and the client can be used with Remote Desktop Gateway for controlled access through firewalls.

This solution is ideal for remote employees, administrators, and support teams who need dependable performance and clear session management. Whether you’re accessing a workstation for daily tasks, connecting to a server for maintenance, or working with a virtual desktop infrastructure, Microsoft Remote Desktop delivers stable connectivity and a consistent experience. Configure it once, connect in seconds, and keep your work environment available whenever you need it—at the office, at home, or on the move.
